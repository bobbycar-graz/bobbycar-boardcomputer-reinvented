# bobbycar-boardcomputer-reinvented PCB / KiCAD
This PCB will have both MCUs, a few connectors and a USB-C port for flashing.

## Ideas
- USB-C for flashing
  - For reducing costs, only have one USB-C port on the PCB and use some kind of switch (for example DIP switches) to select which MCU to flash. (TBD if this can work)
